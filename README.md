## Hi there 👋

### I'm Marcellus Harris

I'm a Security+ certified cybersecurity professional with a passion for cyber defense and automation. I design and build tools that transform messy logs into actionable insights—combining Python, Bash, Splunk, and n8n to detect threats, triage alerts, and automate responses. From port scanning and vulnerability assessment to phishing URL triage and threat‑intel aggregation, my projects bridge blue‑team analysis with modern automation. I love exploring new security frameworks, sharing what I learn, and helping teams stay ahead of evolving threats.

**🌟 Projects & Tools I'm most proud of**

- **Automated Port Scanner & Vulnerability Assessment** – A Python-based scanner that identifies open ports and flags high-risk services; featured at BootCon.
- **Splunk Threat Detection** – Custom dashboards and alerts to surface malicious PowerShell activity and host-based anomalies.
- **Incident Response Toolkit** – Cross-platform evidence collector script for Windows, macOS and Linux.
- **Cloud Security Auditor** – Lightweight auditor that checks AWS accounts for common misconfigurations and outputs CSV/JSON/HTML reports.

**🎓 Top skills & certifications**

- **Security+ Certified** – CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601)
- **Splunk Core** – Splunk User / Administrator skills
- **Programming** – Python, Bash; comfortable with nmap, Wireshark and basic Windows/macOS administration
- **Cloud & DevOps** – Familiar with AWS and Azure fundamentals, Orchestration Workflows (n8n), and GitHub Actions
